  <h2><b>Terminal Maps</b></h2>
  <h3><b> <p>The beautiful SRQ terminal building is a combination of efficiency, comfort and aesthetics, with a distinct local flavor.</p></b></h3>
  <p>For your convenience, the terminal features very short walking distances, with a simple progression from the parking lot, to check-in counters, to security screening and onto the concourse. For arriving passengers, the distances are equally as short from the gates. Walking to the baggage claim area from an arrival gate takes only a few minutes; once there you will find car rental counters. The parking lot and ground transportation are easily accessible adjacent to the baggage claim area.</p>
